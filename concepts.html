<p>Community:
Whether growing up with your family in a small town, part of the college campus or a working professional students within CSS strive to help grow and influence their community in a positive way. Communities come together to work towards a common goal, at college a community can share in the stresses of homework, the excitement of their team winning a game and the joy of graduating. A CSS student strives to continue joining in with the community as it extends into their professional life, helping those in social and economic issues on local, national and global scales.</p>

Giving the idea of community throughout life, starting out with family as infant/child growing into teen years hanging out at the beach/surfing, a little older teenager helping at a foodbank etc.. Moving to college age cheering on a team game, leading towards professional view showing a psychiatrist helping a client. Helps to show growth within communities, and encouragement of helping in the community, and the opportunity to expand and help others outside the smaller/local community.</p>

<p>Color Palette:
Light blues and greens to help tie into the overall community (UH), and to help show life and growth within the community.</p>

<p>Thrive:
One of the main points conveyed by the HS students was how much their parents work to provide for them, how they&rsquo;re the one of the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; that the student looks up to. Thrive plays off this, showing that throughout a persons life, there are others to help them &ldquo;thrive&rdquo;, whether it&rsquo;s a parent working 14 hour shifts as a hotel cleaner, a full time doctor that helps their son get into the best schools possible, or a grandmother that takes care of the kids if the parents are not in the picture. Once the student is out of the house, UH CSS is there to help the student thrive, with professors working to help the student achieve greatness in their classes and prepare the student to thrive in their future professions.</p>
